# 🧪 dotfiles

> ⚙️ My personal Arch Linux dotfiles – optimized for Hyprland + Wayland workflow.

This repository contains my full system configuration for Arch Linux using **Hyprland**, designed to be clean, minimal, and efficient.  
Everything is managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to keep things modular and easy to maintain.
